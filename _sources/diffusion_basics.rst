Diffusion
=========

pyro solves the constant-conductivity diffusion equation:

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = k \nabla^2 \phi

This is done implicitly using multigrid, using the solver :py:mod:`pyro.diffusion`.

The diffusion equation is discretized using Crank-Nicolson
differencing (this makes the diffusion operator time-centered) and the
implicit discretization forms a Helmholtz equation solved by the pyro
multigrid class. The main parameters that affect this solver are:

.. include:: diffusion_defaults.inc

Examples
--------

gaussian
^^^^^^^^

The gaussian problem initializes a strongly peaked Gaussian centered
in the domain. The analytic solution for this shows that the profile
remains a Gaussian, with a changing width and peak. This allows us to
compare our solver to the analytic solution. This is run as:

.. prompt:: bash

   pyro_sim.py diffusion gaussian inputs.gaussian

.. image:: gauss_diffusion.png
   :align: center

The above figure shows the scalar field after diffusing significantly
from its initial strongly peaked state. We can compare to the analytic
solution by making radial profiles of the scalar. The plot below shows
the numerical solution (red points) overplotted on the analytic
solution (solid curves) for several different times. The y-axis is
restricted in range to bring out the detail at later times.

Exercises
---------

The best way to learn these methods is to play with them yourself. The
exercises below are suggestions for explorations and features to add
to the advection solver.

Explorations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Test the convergence of the solver by varying the resolution and
  comparing to the analytic solution.

* How does the solution error change as the CFL number is increased
  well above 1?

* Setup some other profiles and experiment with different boundary conditions.

Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^

* Switch from Crank-Nicolson (2nd order in time) to backward Euler
  (1st order in time) and compare the solution and convergence. This
  should only require changing the source term and coefficients used in
  setting up the multigrid solve. It does not require changes to the
  multigrid solver itself.

* Implement a non-constant coefficient diffusion solverâ€”note: this
  will require improving the multigrid solver.
