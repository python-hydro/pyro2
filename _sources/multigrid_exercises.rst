Explorations
------------

* Try doing just smoothing, no multigrid. Show that it still converges
  second order if you use enough iterations, but that the amount of
  time needed to get a solution is much greater.

Extensions
----------

* Add a different bottom solver to the multigrid algorithm

* Make the multigrid solver work for non-square domains

* Implement the full-multigrid algorithm instead of just V-cycles
