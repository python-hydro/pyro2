This is a simple list of the improvements we wish to make to pyro.


coding:

     * it seems in __init__ and for other imports we need to explicitly put a .

       we may need something like:

       try:
           from . import mymodule     # "myapp" case
       except:
           import mymodule            # "__main__" case

       (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1112618/import-python-package-from-local-directory-into-interpreter)

  -- rewrite to adhere to python style guidelines

  -- is there a way to define a range like ii = [myg.ilo:myg.ihi+1]
     and then do something like ii+1 to get [myg.ilo+1:myg.ihi+2]?

     or perhaps have a shift method, and do something like

     a = mydata.get_var("density")
     
     a.s("i+1","j")

     and retain the original behavor of normal indexing via:

     a.d

     which would point to the data


new solvers:

  -- Burgers equation (viscous and inviscid)

  -- low Mach number hydro (both combustion and atmospheric)


infrastructure:

  -- well-defined unit tests

  -- the MG solvers should check that the incoming coefficient arrays
     have the same # of ghost cells -- perhaps the coefficients should
     come in as their own ccdata2d object? or pass in a grid object
     like we do got mg.get_solution()
