Introduction to pyro
====================

pyro is a simple framework for implementing and playing with
hydrodynamics solvers.  It is designed to provide a tutorial for
students in computational astrophysics (and hydrodynamics in general)
and for easily prototyping new methods.  We introduce simple
implementations of some popular methods used in the field, with the
code written to be easily understandable. All simulations use a single
grid (no domain decomposition).

.. note::

   pyro is not meant for demanding scientific simulationsâ€”given the
   choice between performance and clarity, clarity is taken.

pyro builds off of a finite-volume framework for solving PDEs. There
are a number of solvers in pyro, allowing for the solution of
hyperbolic (wave), parabolic (diffusion), and elliptic (Poisson)
equations. In particular, the following solvers are developed:

* linear advection

* Burgers' equation

* compressible hydrodynamics

* special relativistic compressible hydrodynamics

* shallow water hydrodynamics

* multigrid

* implicit thermal diffusion

* inviscid incompressible hydrodynamics

* viscous incompressible hydrodynamics

* low Mach number atmospheric hydrodynamics

Runtime visualization shows the evolution as the equations are solved.
