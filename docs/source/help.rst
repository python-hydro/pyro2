Contributing and getting help
=============================

Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcomed from anyone, including posting issues or
submitting pull requests to the `pyro github <https://github.com/python-hydro/pyro2>`_.

Users who make significant contributions will be listed as developers
in the pyro acknowledgements and be included in any future code
papers.

Issues
------

Creating an issue on github is a good way to request new features,
file a bug report, or notify us of any difficulties that arise using
pyro.

To request support using pyro, please create an issue on the pyro
github and the developers will be happy to assist you.

If you are reporting a bug, please indicate any information necessary
to reproduce the bug including your version of python.

Pull Requests
-------------

*Any contributions that have the potential to change answers should be
done via pull requests.* A pull request should be generated from your
fork of pyro and target the `main` branch.

The unit and regression tests will run automatically once the PR is
submitted, and then one of the pyro developers will review the PR and
if needed, suggest modifications prior to merging the PR.

If there are a number of small commits making up the PR, we may wish
to squash commits upon merge to have a clean history.  *Please ensure
that your PR title and first post are descriptive, since these will be
used for a squashed commit message.*

Discussions
-----------

We use github discussions:
https://github.com/python-hydro/pyro2/discussions
for support.  You are encouraged to post in the discussions
to ask questions.
