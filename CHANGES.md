  * the `advection_fv4` solver now properly averages the initial
    conditions from centers to cell-averages

  * each problem initial conditions file now specifies a
    `DEFAULT_INPUTS` (#225)

  * the gresho initial conditions were fixed to be closer to the
    source of the Miczek et al. paper (#218)

  * the RT initial conditions were tweaked to be more symmetric (#216)

    (r-theta) (#204, #210, #211)

  * the mesh now supports spherical geometry (r-theta) (#201, #217)

  * the compressible Riemann solvers were reorganized (#206)

  * CI fixes (#202, #215) and a codespell action (#199, #205)

  * python 3.12 was added to the CI (#208)

  * comment fixes to the compressible FV4 solver (#207)

# 4.1.0

  * Switched to pyproject.toml (#195)

  * pytest improvements allowing it to be run more easily (#194)

  * plotvar.py script improvements (#178)

  * a new viscous Burgers solver was added (#171)

  * a new viscous incompressible solver was added with a lid-drive
    cavity test problem (#138)

  * the incompressible solver was synced up with the Burgers solver
    (#168, #169)

  * convergence.py can now take any variable and multiplicative
    factor, as well as take 3 plotfiles to estimate convergence
    directly. (#165)

  * plot.py can fill ghostcells now (#156)

  * a new inviscid Burgers solver was added (#144)

  * we can now Ctrl+C to abort when visualization is on (#131)

  * lots of pylint cleaning (#155, #152, #151, #143, #139)

# 4.0

  This begins a new development campaign, with the source updated to
  conform to a standard python packaging format, allowing us to put
  it up on PyPI, and install and run from anywhere.

# 3.1

  This is essentially the version from JOSS

# 3.0

  This was the transition to Numba

# 2.2

  * added shallow water solver

  * added particles support

# 2.1

  * documentation switched to Sphinx

  * extensive flake8 clean-ups

  * travis-ci for unit test (with 79% coverage)

  * SDC compressible method added

# 2.0

  This is the state of the project toward the end of 2017.
  4th order finite-volume methods were just introduced.
